# Python-Project1
My First project on python was about extracting the seller data of various products over websites and report it to the company.

I have worked on two major weebsites the codes for both are in the repository. you can also see the code in jpg image if you dont want to open the python code file.

if you work with the python code
- create a sample of url as "anyname.txt"
- pass the path and name of this text file correctly in the code.
- give the path for the report (where it should get stored)
- 
The report generated in in excel worksheet, it can also be done in csv, text etc type of files with alteration in pandas.

i have used diffrent types of libraries during the project some are mentioned below
- BeautifulSoup, Requests, Selenium, Pandas, datetime, math, Regex.
